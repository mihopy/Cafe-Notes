# Cafe Notes
My first project for recording and displaying notes about the cafés and coffees I’ve tried. Built with Flask and SQLAlchemy, and styled using Bootstrap, this simple blog-style app lets you keep a personal log of café visits—including your thoughts, ratings, etc.  It’s an easy way to track your coffee adventures and revisit past experiences in a clean, user-friendly layout.
